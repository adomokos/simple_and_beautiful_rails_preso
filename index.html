                          <p>I am not going to teach you functional programming. I am not going to try bending the Ruby language to be a functional one, either.
                            Hopefully I'll show you refactored and elegant Ruby code. So if you're ready, let's roll.</p>

                          <p>I have a 25 minutes commute to work and I listen to audio books while I drive. A friend recommended reading the book: "The EMyth Revisited".
                            The sentence "the work you do is a reflection of who are" got stuck in my brain.<br>
                            Translated to our profession, we could say: "The kind of code you write is a reflection of who YOU ARE."</p>

                          <p>I am obsessed with the quality of roads. Unfortunately, in Northeast Ohio the roads are in really bad shape. We blame it
                            on the weather, but I think the quality of work has a part to it, too. This pothole took more than a couple of weeks to grow this big.

                          the Chinese government. Since they couldn't wait building the highway, they just paved around it.</p>

                            The calculate_shipping has 207 lines. And the recalculate_shipping has 196 lines in it! Somebody just copied the calculate_shipping

                          <p>I wanted to find a tool that measures code complexity. The best one out there is the FLOG gem. Understanding the result is simple:
                            "The higher the score the harder it is to test the code". It uses ABC metrics: assignments, branching and calls.<br>
                            I analyzed that model you saw in the previous slide: it has a total flog value of 2592!</p>

                          <p>I've worked on many Rails app in the last couple of years. I wanted to use an example to show you the different ideas I've tried.
                            The is a tracking app, where you can provide all the data in one text and the system parses it out into category and track records.
                            It will also check if the category already exists and will use that to file that track.<br>
                            You can optionally provide the date in the front in case you want to use date other than today's date.</p>

                          <h4>15 -  Domain Logic in Controller Action</h4>
                          <p>Using my example app, I put all the parsing logic in the controller action. The action has 48 lines of code, which is not bad considering
                            what we all did a decade ago: all logic went in the views. Do you remember those good old ASP days?<br>But seriously: 48 lines of domain logic
                            in the controller?! Yeah: WTF.</p>

                          <p>I am comparing the TracksController and Track model with Flog. The Track model has already some logic around displaying dynamic properties.
                          But the action has a Flog value of 46.2.</p>

                          <p>Having all logic in one method is bad. After extracting a couple of methods the controller is a bit easier to read, but I think this code is still
                          a mess. At least the total LOC for this action went down from 48 to 25.</p>

                          <p>The Rails community eventually figured out that putting domain logic in the controller isn't so great. By moving the logic from the controller
                            into the models we let the controller do its work: orchestrate between views and models.</p>

                          <p>After moving the parsing logic into the model the controller now has only 12 lines of code. The controller sends the message to the model,
                            the model is saved by the controller and handles the result accordingly.<br>
                            This controller code is simple and easy to understand, something I'd be happy with.</p>

                          <p>This is where my story begins. After going through a couple of tutorials and placing most of the logic in models I soon started
                            breaking out of Rails and putting domain logic in Rails-independent service objects.<br>The benefits to me was huge: running specs
                            in sub-seconds instead of 23 seconds.</p>

                             sends a message to the service object.</p>

                            called other methods within the same object.<br>
                            In the context of this example the controller called the "for_track" method which in turn called other methods on itself.</p>

                             complex test setups. As I added more logic, the tests became even more brittle.<br>

                             a much cleaner organization of my code. Two types of objects emerged: the single organizer object and the small action objects.</p>

                            Most of the things we do are a series of tasks. The parsing logic I used in my example has several steps: it splits the feed to parts,
                            it parses out the recorded at date, validates the remainder of the feed, etc.</p>

                            Influenced by this Gof4 Pattern I came up with a slight variation of it: The Series of Actions. Instead of actions calling the next one
                            in the chain I let the organizer set up the order and call them one by one.

                          <p>To visualize my experiment I came up with this graph. While the complexity grew with O(n) in the controller the Series of Actions remained
                            static with O(1).</p>

                            I was asked when I would build out Series of Actions: well, I might put a conditional in the controller action,
                            but once the code gets more complex I break it out into services and test drive the logic there.</p>

                          <p>And to sum this all up: get out of the framework as complexity arises. Elegant code should tell you a story. Don't use state if you don't 
                            have to, it increases complexity. Separate behavior from data, it let's you follow SRP. Introduce new classes or new actions instead of adding 
                            new methods to a model or a service.
